# NVC Difficult Conversation

## Overview

Nonviolent Communication (NVC) framework for addressing conflicts and difficult conversations. Focuses on connecting human-to-human rather than winning/losing. Reduces defensiveness and increases understanding.

**When to use**: Conflict, tension, need to address difficult topic, feeling unheard, before potentially charged conversation

## Quick Reference

| Step | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| 0. Self-connection | Internal check-in first | "What am I feeling and needing?" |
| 1. Observation | "When I see/hear..." | "When the report wasn't ready Tuesday..." |
| 2. Feeling | "I feel..." | "I feel worried and frustrated..." |
| 3. Need | "Because I need..." | "Because I need reliability and partnership..." |
| 4. Request | "Would you be willing...?" | "Would you be willing to let me know if deadlines can't be met?" |
| 5. Listen | Hear their response | Reflect what you heard |

## The Process

### Phase 0: Self-Connection (BEFORE the conversation)

**DO NOT skip this step.** Going into a difficult conversation while reactive creates more conflict.

**Actions**:
1. Use the inner:self-connection skill
2. Get clear on YOUR feelings and needs first
3. Check: Can I hear "no" to my request? (If not, you're making a demand, and they'll feel it)

**Gut check**: If you're not clear on what YOU need, you're not ready for the conversation yet.

**AskUserQuestion**: "Before we plan what to say, what are YOU feeling and needing?"

### Phase 1: Observation (Facts Only, No Evaluation)

State specific, observable behavior without judgment, interpretation, or exaggeration.

**Format**: "When I see/hear [specific observable thing]..."

**Good observations** (just facts):
- "When the report wasn't ready by Tuesday as we agreed..."
- "When I heard 'that won't work' in the meeting..."
- "When I saw the email sent to the full team..."

**Bad observations** (judgment disguised as observation):
- "When you're always late with everything..." (exaggeration + "always")
- "When you don't care about deadlines..." (interpretation of intent)
- "When you're being difficult..." (evaluation, not observation)

**Test**: Could a video camera capture what you're describing? If no, it's interpretation.

**Why this matters**: Judgments trigger defensiveness. Observations allow the other person to hear you.

### Phase 2: Express Feelings (Own Your Experience)

Share YOUR emotional experience without blaming.

**Format**: "I feel [emotion word]..."

**Use actual feeling words**:
- Sad, angry, scared, frustrated, disappointed, worried, hurt, lonely, confused, overwhelmed, excited, relieved, grateful

**Not feeling words** (these are thoughts/interpretations):
- "I feel like you don't care" → THOUGHT. The feeling might be "hurt" or "angry"
- "I feel that you're wrong" → THOUGHT. The feeling might be "frustrated" or "scared"
- "I feel manipulated" → INTERPRETATION. The feeling might be "angry" or "scared"

**Own your feelings**: "I feel frustrated" (not "You made me feel frustrated")

**Why this matters**: When you own your feelings, people can hear them. When you blame them for your feelings, they defend themselves.

### Phase 3: State Needs (Universal Human Needs, Not Strategies)

Express the universal human need that's not being met.

**Format**: "Because I need [need/value]..."

**Universal needs** (everyone has these):
- Respect, trust, honesty, collaboration, partnership
- Clarity, understanding, to be heard
- Safety, predictability, reliability
- Growth, learning, competence
- Autonomy, choice, freedom

**Not needs** (these are strategies):
- "Because I need you to turn things in on time" → STRATEGY. The need is "reliability" or "partnership"
- "Because I need this meeting to happen" → STRATEGY. The need is "collaboration" or "inclusion"
- "Because I need you to change" → STRATEGY. The need might be "ease" or "harmony"

**Test**: Is this need something everyone values? (If yes, it's a need. If only specific to this situation, it's a strategy.)

**Why this matters**: When you speak to universal needs, people can connect. We might disagree on strategies but we all share the same needs.

### Phase 4: Make Request (Specific, Doable, Positive)

Ask for a specific action that would meet the need.

**Format**: "Would you be willing to [specific doable action]?"

**Good requests** (specific, doable, positive):
- "Would you be willing to let me know by Monday if Tuesday deadline is at risk?"
- "Would you be willing to share your concerns with me directly before the team meeting?"
- "Would you be willing to send a status update every Friday?"

**Bad requests** (vague, negative, or demands):
- "Would you be willing to stop being late?" (negative, vague)
- "Would you be willing to care more?" (not observable or doable)
- "You need to turn this in on time" (demand, not request)

**Test for request vs. demand**: If "no" is not acceptable, it's a demand. Request means you're genuinely willing to hear "no" and negotiate.

**Why this matters**: Requests preserve autonomy and invite collaboration. Demands trigger resistance and compliance (not willing cooperation).

### Phase 5: Listen to Their Response (Empathic Listening)

They will have their own observations, feelings, needs, and requests. LISTEN.

**Actions**:
1. Don't defend, explain, or justify yet
2. Listen for THEIR feelings and needs
3. Reflect back what you heard: "It sounds like you're feeling [feeling] because you need [need]. Is that right?"
4. Ask questions to understand: "Can you tell me more about what happened for you?"

**When they're reactive**: They might not use NVC format. Listen for the feelings and needs underneath their words.

Example:
- They say: "This is ridiculous! You're micromanaging!"
- You hear: Feeling = angry, frustrated. Need = autonomy, trust
- You reflect: "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated because you need more autonomy in how you handle your work. Is that right?"

**Why this matters**: When people feel heard, defensiveness drops. Then real conversation can happen.

### Phase 6: Co-Create Solutions

Once both people's needs are on the table, find strategies that work for both.

**Ask**:
- "What could work for both of us here?"
- "How can we meet both our needs?"
- "What if we tried [idea]? Would that work for you?"

**Brainstorm together**: Multiple strategies might meet both sets of needs. Don't get locked into your first idea.

## Key Principles

**Source**: Marshall Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication (NVC)

**Why it works**:
- **Observations without evaluation** reduce defensiveness (hearing facts vs. hearing attack)
- **Owning feelings** allows them to be heard (vs. blamed)
- **Speaking to universal needs** creates connection (we all have the same needs)
- **Requests vs. demands** preserve autonomy and willing cooperation
- **Both people's needs matter**: Not my needs OR yours, but AND. Solutions serve both.

**Core insight**: Behind every action is an attempt to meet a need. When we connect at the level of needs, we can find strategies that work for everyone.

**What NVC is NOT**:
- Not a formula to get your way
- Not passive or weak (it's honest and direct)
- Not about being "nice" (it's about being authentic and connected)

## Common Pitfalls

- **Skipping self-connection**: Going into conversation while reactive = more conflict. Do Phase 0 first. Always.

- **Disguised judgments as observations**: "When you're being irresponsible..." is NOT an observation. The judgment triggers defensiveness.

- **Fake feelings**: "I feel like you don't care" is a thought. Find the actual feeling underneath (hurt? angry? sad?).

- **Needs vs. strategies confusion**: "I need you to do X" is not a need. Identify the universal need underneath the specific strategy.

- **Demands disguised as requests**: If hearing "no" would trigger you, you're making a demand. Requests mean genuine willingness to hear no and negotiate.

- **Using NVC as manipulation**: The framework is for connection, not for getting your way while sounding nice. People can feel inauthenticity.

- **Skipping listening**: After you speak, LISTEN. Their needs matter too. This isn't a monologue.

## Examples

**Example 1: Missed deadline**

**Self-connection first**:
- Feeling: Frustrated and worried
- Need: Reliability, partnership, to meet commitments to clients

**The conversation**:

**Observation**: "When the report wasn't ready for Tuesday's client meeting as we agreed..."

**Feeling**: "I felt frustrated and worried..."

**Need**: "Because I need reliability and partnership so we can deliver on our commitments to clients..."

**Request**: "Would you be willing to reach out earlier if you realize you can't meet a deadline, so we can problem-solve together?"

**Listen**:
- They respond: "I've been completely overwhelmed. I tried to finish but there weren't enough hours."
- You reflect: "It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed because you need support or more reasonable deadlines?"
- They confirm: "Yes, exactly. I have too much on my plate."

**Co-create**: "What if we looked at your workload and reprioritized, and built in slack time for unexpected issues? Would that help?"

**Example 2: Interrupted in meeting**

**Self-connection**:
- Feeling: Hurt and discouraged
- Need: Respect, to contribute meaningfully

**The conversation**:

**Observation**: "When I was interrupted three times in this morning's meeting before I could finish my point..."

**Feeling**: "I felt hurt and discouraged..."

**Need**: "Because I need to be able to contribute and have my ideas heard fully..."

**Request**: "Would you be willing to let me complete my thoughts before responding, even if you disagree?"

**Listen**:
- They respond: "I didn't realize I was doing that. I get excited about ideas and jump in."
- You reflect: "So you're feeling engaged and excited and want to contribute too?"
- They confirm: "Yes! I wasn't trying to shut you down."

**Co-create**: "What if we used a 'raise hand' signal when someone's not done speaking? Would that work for both of us?"

**Example 3: Conflict over direction**

**Situation**: Team disagreement about which approach to take

**Without NVC**:
- "Your idea won't work" → "Yes it will, you're being stubborn"
- Positional arguing, defensiveness, damaged relationships

**With NVC**:

**Person A**: "When I hear the proposal to build feature X first, I feel worried because I need to deliver value to users quickly and I'm not sure X serves our main user need. Would you be willing to share what you see as the value of starting with X?"

**Person B** (heard, not defensive): "I feel frustrated because I need us to address technical debt, and X lets us refactor the core. But I hear that you need to deliver user value. Can we find a way to do both?"

**Co-create**: "What if we did a smaller version of X that addresses some tech debt AND delivers user value? Could that work?"

**Outcome**: Both needs met (user value + technical health), stronger relationship
