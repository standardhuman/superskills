# Sleep Routine

## Overview

Evidence-based sleep system covering wind-down, sleep environment, consistent schedule, and morning wake protocol. Sleep is foundational - it affects everything else (strength, nutrition, focus, mood). This skill creates the habits that make quality sleep automatic.

**When to use**: Improving sleep quality, creating evening routine, addressing morning tiredness, recovering from disrupted sleep

**Key insight**: You can't force sleep through willpower. You can only create the conditions for sleep to happen. This skill focuses on those conditions.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Action | Timing |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1. Wind-Down | Transition ritual | 90-60 min before bed |
| 2. Environment | Optimize sleep space | Before bed |
| 3. Pre-Sleep | Final preparation | 30-15 min before bed |
| 4. Wake Protocol | Morning light & movement | First 30 min after waking |
| 5. Consistency | Same times daily | Ongoing |

**Recovery protocols included**: Bad night recovery, travel/jetlag, stress disruption

## The Process

### Phase 1: Wind-Down (90-60 minutes before bed)

Signal to your body that the day is ending. This is about transition, not optimization.

**Core actions**:
1. **Stop work completely** (see productivity:daily-shutdown)
2. **Reduce light exposure** - dim lights, switch to warm bulbs, enable night mode
3. **No screens** (or blue-light filtered with reduced brightness)
4. **No intense exercise** (light stretching okay)
5. **No heavy meals** (small snack okay if needed)

**Choose your wind-down activities** (pick 2-3):
- Reading (physical book)
- Light conversation with partner/family
- Gentle stretching or yoga
- Journaling or reflection
- Music (calm, instrumental)
- Hot bath or shower (drops core temp after)
- Meditation or breathing exercises

**The caffeine rule**: No caffeine after 2pm (caffeine has 6-hour half-life). If you're caffeine-sensitive, make it noon.

**Why 90 minutes?** Adenosine (sleep pressure) and melatonin need time to build. Screens and stimulation suppress both.

### Phase 2: Environment (Before bed)

Optimize your sleep space for darkness, coolness, and quiet.

**Temperature**: 65-68°F (18-20°C)
- Body needs to drop core temperature to initiate sleep
- Cool room + warm blanket is ideal
- Hot shower 1-2 hours before bed helps (vasodilation drops core temp)

**Darkness**: Aim for "can't see your hand" dark
- Blackout curtains or sleep mask
- Cover LED lights (tape, unplug, or remove)
- No light from phone/devices

**Sound**: Consistent or silent
- White noise machine or fan
- Earplugs if needed
- Eliminate sudden sounds (silence notifications)

**Air quality**: Fresh, not stale
- Crack window if possible
- Air purifier if allergies

**Mattress and pillows**: Comfortable for YOUR body
- Side sleepers need more pillow height
- Back sleepers need less
- Mattress matters but is personal preference

**Phone location**: NOT in bedroom, or at minimum across the room
- Nightstand phone = midnight scrolling
- Buy an alarm clock

### Phase 3: Pre-Sleep (30-15 minutes before bed)

Final preparation for actual sleep.

**Actions**:
1. Use bathroom (prevents middle-of-night waking)
2. Brush teeth (signals "day is done")
3. Light stretching or body scan (2-3 min)
4. Set consistent "lights out" time

**If mind is racing**:
- Write down worries on paper (externalize them)
- "Worry time" - 10 minutes to think it all through, then done
- 4-7-8 breathing: inhale 4 sec, hold 7 sec, exhale 8 sec
- Body scan from toes to head (progressive relaxation)

**Don't try to force sleep**: Lying in bed awake for 20+ minutes trains your brain that bed = awake. Get up, do something boring (read in dim light), return when sleepy.

### Phase 4: Wake Protocol (First 30 minutes)

How you wake affects your entire day and tonight's sleep.

**Immediate actions** (first 10 minutes):
1. **Get light** - sunlight is best, light box if needed
   - 10+ minutes of bright light within 30 min of waking
   - This resets circadian rhythm and promotes evening sleepiness
2. **Get up** - no snooze button
   - Snoozing fragments sleep architecture
   - If you need 5 more alarms, go to bed earlier
3. **Hydrate** - glass of water before coffee
   - You're dehydrated after 7-8 hours without water

**Delay caffeine**: Wait 90-120 minutes after waking
- Adenosine (sleepiness chemical) is high on waking
- Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors
- Early caffeine = crash later when it wears off and adenosine floods in
- Letting adenosine clear naturally = more stable energy

**Morning movement**: Light activity within first hour
- Walk, stretch, or light exercise
- Movement raises core body temperature
- Signals to body "daytime has begun"

**See health:strength-program** for workout timing considerations.

### Phase 5: Consistency (Ongoing)

The most important factor: same bed/wake times every day.

**The rule**: Same time ±30 minutes, including weekends

**Why consistency matters**:
- Circadian rhythm syncs to light AND timing
- Irregular schedule = perpetual jetlag
- "Social jetlag" (late weekends, early weekdays) fragments sleep quality

**When to adjust**:
- Occasional late night (1-2x/month) is fine
- Still wake at same time (tired day better than rhythm disruption)
- Nap only if under 20 min before 3pm

**Building the habit**:
- Set recurring alarm for bedtime wind-down start
- Track sleep/wake times for 2 weeks (observe patterns)
- Gradual shifts (15 min earlier every 3-4 days if needed)

## Recovery Protocols

### Bad Night Recovery

You had a terrible night. Here's how to prevent a cascade:

**DO**:
- Wake at normal time anyway
- Get extra morning light (helps reset)
- Short nap if needed (<20 min, before 3pm)
- Earlier wind-down tonight
- Accept lower performance today

**DON'T**:
- Sleep in (shifts rhythm)
- Extra caffeine (blocks tonight's sleep)
- Skip exercise (movement helps)
- Nap after 3pm (wrecks tonight)
- Stress about it (stress worsens sleep)

**Key insight**: One bad night won't hurt you. The panic response and compensatory behaviors hurt more.

### Travel & Jetlag

**Before travel**:
- Shift bedtime 30 min toward destination time zone for 3 days
- Stay hydrated on flight
- Avoid alcohol on flight

**On arrival**:
- Get bright light at destination morning time
- Stay awake until local bedtime (push through if afternoon arrival)
- Melatonin 0.5-1mg at destination bedtime (first 3-4 nights only)

**Returning home**: Same protocol in reverse

### Stress Disruption

When stress is wrecking your sleep:

**Actions**:
1. Acknowledge: "I'm stressed and that's affecting sleep"
2. Longer wind-down (2 hours instead of 90 min)
3. Write worries down (paper, not phone)
4. Use inner:self-connection skill if emotions are intense
5. Accept imperfect sleep (fighting it makes it worse)
6. Focus on what you can control (environment, schedule, wind-down)

**If chronic**: Consider whether sleep issue is symptom of underlying stress that needs direct addressing.

## Key Principles

**Framework sources**:
- **Matthew Walker** ("Why We Sleep") - science of sleep architecture
- **Andrew Huberman** (Huberman Lab) - light exposure, caffeine timing, temperature
- **National Sleep Foundation** - environment guidelines, sleep hygiene

**Why this system works**:
1. **Creates conditions, not force**: You can't will yourself to sleep; you can only remove barriers
2. **Consistency over perfection**: Regular schedule trumps perfect nights
3. **Light is the master control**: Morning light + evening darkness drives circadian rhythm
4. **Temperature initiates sleep**: Cool room, body temp drop triggers sleep onset
5. **Caffeine is a tool, not a crutch**: Strategic timing > more caffeine

**Integration with other health skills**:
- **Sleep → Strength**: Recovery happens during sleep. Poor sleep = poor gains. (See health:strength-program)
- **Sleep → Nutrition**: Sleep deprivation increases hunger hormones (ghrelin up, leptin down). (See health:nutrition-planning)
- **Sleep affects everything**: Mood, focus, willpower, decision-making, immune function

## Common Pitfalls

**"Just one more episode/chapter"**: No hard stop time. Set alarm for wind-down start and respect it. The show will be there tomorrow.

**Inconsistent weekends**: Staying up 2 hours later on weekends and sleeping in creates social jetlag. Same time ±30 min, every day.

**Phone in bed**: Blue light + infinite scroll + notifications. Phone charges outside bedroom. Buy an alarm clock.

**Caffeine after 2pm**: Even if you "can" fall asleep, caffeine fragments sleep architecture. You sleep but don't recover as well.

**"I'll sleep when I'm dead"**: Sleep debt is real. Chronic under-sleeping (6 hours when you need 7-8) accumulates cognitive impairment. You can't "get used to" less sleep - you just get used to impaired performance.

**Fighting bad nights**: Lying in bed frustrated trains brain that bed = stress. Get up, do something boring, return when sleepy.

**Thinking one hack fixes it**: Blue-light glasses won't save you if your schedule is chaos. System matters more than tactics.

**Over-optimizing**: Tracking every metric obsessively creates sleep anxiety. Simple routine, consistent timing, reasonable environment. That's 90% of it.

## Examples

**Example 1: Software engineer with late-night second wind**

**Problem**: Gets "second wind" at 10pm, codes until 1am, drags through mornings. Knows it's a problem but can't stop.

**System implemented**:
- Hard stop at 9pm (alarm for wind-down start)
- Screens off, lights dim
- Evening walk or reading until 10:30pm
- Phone charges in living room
- Alarm at 6:30am regardless of bedtime
- Morning walk (10 min) before coffee
- Caffeine delayed until 8am

**First 2 weeks**: Rough. Second wind still came, had to resist.

**After 1 month**: Second wind disappeared. Energy shifted to mornings. More productive in fewer hours.

**Key insight**: The "second wind" was a cortisol spike from blue light and stimulation - not natural energy.

**Example 2: Parent with unpredictable schedule**

**Problem**: Kids wake at random times. Partner works shifts. "Perfect sleep routine" seemed impossible.

**Adapted system**:
- Can't control wake time, so focused on what she COULD control
- Consistent wind-down routine (even if timing varies)
- Environment optimized (blackout curtains, white noise, cool temp)
- Morning light within 30 min of any wake-up
- No caffeine after noon (protects whatever sleep is possible)

**Result**: Didn't achieve "perfect" 8 hours. But same inputs (wind-down, environment, light exposure) meant BETTER sleep within constraints.

**Key insight**: Imperfect execution of good system beats no system at all.

**Example 3: Jet-setter with constant travel**

**Problem**: Different time zone every week. Perpetual jet lag. Using sleeping pills and felt groggy.

**Travel system**:
- Portable blackout mask and earplugs (always packed)
- Blue-light glasses for evening flights
- Melatonin protocol (0.5mg at destination bedtime for 3-4 nights)
- Non-negotiable: morning light on arrival
- Maintains wake time in home time zone when trip <3 days

**Result**: Jet lag still happens but recovers in 2 days instead of 5. No more sleeping pills. Performs better on trips.

**Key insight**: Can't eliminate jet lag, but can minimize with strategic light exposure and melatonin timing.

**Example 4: Connection to daily-shutdown**

**The integrated system**:

5:30pm - **daily-shutdown** ritual (work closure)
→ Mind released from work thoughts

6:00pm - Dinner, family time

8:30pm - **sleep-routine wind-down** begins
→ Screens off, lights dim, evening activities

10:00pm - Pre-sleep routine, lights out

6:30am - Wake, morning light, movement

7:00am - **daily-startup** ritual (see productivity:daily-startup)

**Why integration works**: Daily-shutdown handles work closure so wind-down doesn't need to process work stress. Daily-startup captures the morning energy that good sleep provides.
