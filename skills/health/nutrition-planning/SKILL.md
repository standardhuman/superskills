# Nutrition Planning

## Overview

Evidence-based approach to fueling your body for health and performance. Covers calculating needs, meal planning, meal prep, tracking options, and adjusting based on results. Designed for sustainability, not perfection.

**When to use**: Starting a nutrition plan, meal prepping, tracking macros, adjusting diet for goals

**Key insight**: Nutrition doesn't need to be complicated. Protein is king. Calories determine weight. Everything else is optimization. Consistency beats perfection.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Action | Frequency |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1. Calculate | Determine calorie and protein needs | Once (reassess every 8-12 weeks) |
| 2. Plan | Design weekly meal framework | Weekly (Sunday planning) |
| 3. Prep | Batch cook and portion | 1-2x per week |
| 4. Track | Monitor intake (method varies) | Daily or as chosen |
| 5. Adjust | Modify based on results | Every 2-4 weeks |

**The 80/20 rule**: 80% whole foods, 20% whatever. Sustainable beats perfect.

## The Process

### Phase 1: Calculate (One Time)

Determine your calorie and protein targets based on goals.

**Step 1: Find maintenance calories (TDEE)**

Quick estimation:
- Sedentary: Bodyweight (lbs) x 12-13
- Lightly active (1-3x exercise/week): Bodyweight x 14-15
- Active (4-5x exercise/week): Bodyweight x 16-17
- Very active (6-7x intense exercise): Bodyweight x 18-19

Example: 180 lb person, exercises 3x/week = 180 x 14 = ~2,520 calories

**Step 2: Set calorie target based on goal**

| Goal | Calories | Expected Rate |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Fat loss | TDEE - 500 | ~1 lb/week loss |
| Fat loss (aggressive) | TDEE - 750 | ~1.5 lb/week loss |
| Maintenance | TDEE | Weight stable |
| Muscle gain (lean) | TDEE + 200-300 | ~0.5 lb/week gain |
| Muscle gain (bulk) | TDEE + 500 | ~1 lb/week gain |

**Don't go below**: Men 1,500 calories, Women 1,200 calories (without medical supervision)

**Step 3: Set protein target**

Protein is the priority macro. Research supports:
- General health: 0.7g per lb bodyweight
- Fat loss (preserving muscle): 0.8-1g per lb bodyweight
- Building muscle: 0.8-1g per lb bodyweight

Example: 180 lb person = 144-180g protein/day

**Step 4: Fill remaining calories**

After protein, split remaining calories between carbs and fats:
- Minimum fat: 0.3g per lb bodyweight (hormones need fat)
- Remaining calories → carbs or personal preference

**Macros math**:
- Protein: 4 calories per gram
- Carbs: 4 calories per gram
- Fat: 9 calories per gram

**Example calculation**:
- 180 lb person, fat loss goal
- Calories: 2,000 (TDEE 2,500 - 500 deficit)
- Protein: 160g = 640 calories
- Fat: 60g = 540 calories (minimum for hormones)
- Remaining: 820 calories = 205g carbs

**AskUserQuestion**: "What's your current weight, goal (fat loss/maintenance/muscle gain), and exercise frequency?"

### Phase 2: Plan (Weekly)

Design a weekly meal framework. Not rigid meal plans - flexible structure.

**Sunday planning session** (15-20 minutes):
1. Check calendar (work meals, social events, travel)
2. Review last week (what worked, what didn't)
3. Plan protein sources for week
4. Make grocery list
5. Schedule prep time

**The template approach**:

Instead of planning every meal, create templates:

**Breakfast template**: Protein + something
- Eggs + toast
- Greek yogurt + fruit + nuts
- Protein shake + oatmeal

**Lunch template**: Protein + vegetable + carb
- Chicken + salad + rice
- Tuna + greens + bread
- Ground beef + peppers + potatoes

**Dinner template**: Protein + vegetable + starch
- Salmon + broccoli + rice
- Steak + asparagus + potatoes
- Chicken thighs + mixed vegetables + pasta

**Snack template**: Protein-forward or whole food
- Greek yogurt
- Protein bar
- Cottage cheese + fruit
- Handful of nuts + cheese

**Why templates work**: You don't decide what to eat; you decide which template to use. Decision fatigue eliminated.

### Phase 3: Prep (Weekly)

Batch cooking makes nutrition automatic. Reactive daily cooking leads to poor choices.

**The 2-hour prep session** (once or twice per week):

**Proteins** (cook 3-4 days worth):
- Bake chicken breasts (season simply, slice when cooled)
- Brown ground beef or turkey
- Hard boil eggs
- Cook salmon or fish

**Carbs** (cook 4-5 days worth):
- Rice (rice cooker makes this trivial)
- Potatoes (bake sheet of sweet potatoes)
- Quinoa or pasta

**Vegetables** (prep but don't overcook):
- Chop vegetables for easy cooking
- Roast sheet pan of vegetables
- Prep salad ingredients (store separately from dressing)

**Portioning**:
- Glass containers (see food, microwave safe)
- Portion by meal or by day
- Label if needed

**The prep workflow**:
1. Preheat oven
2. Start rice cooker
3. Season and put proteins in oven
4. While proteins cook: chop vegetables, prep other items
5. Check proteins, start vegetable roast
6. Cool everything, portion into containers
7. Refrigerate (3-4 days) or freeze (longer)

**Minimal prep alternative** (if 2 hours is too much):
- Buy pre-cooked rotisserie chicken
- Microwave rice packets
- Bagged salad + protein
- Canned tuna/salmon

**Time investment**: 2 hours of prep saves 5+ hours of daily cooking and decision-making.

### Phase 4: Track (Daily)

Tracking keeps you honest. Choose method based on your personality.

**Option A: Full tracking** (highest accuracy)

Use app: MyFitnessPal, Cronometer, MacroFactor, or similar

Log everything:
- Weigh food with kitchen scale
- Scan barcodes
- Log before or immediately after eating

Best for: Goal-oriented phases (cutting, bulking), learning portion sizes

**Option B: Protein tracking only** (moderate effort)

Just track protein grams. Let other macros fall naturally.

Why this works: If you hit protein and eat mostly whole foods, calories often self-regulate.

Best for: Maintenance, those who hate tracking, intuitive eaters

**Option C: Simple rules** (lowest effort)

No tracking. Follow rules instead:
- Protein at every meal (palm-sized portion)
- Fill half plate with vegetables
- Eat until 80% full
- Minimize liquid calories
- Eat processed food infrequently

Best for: Long-term maintenance, those with disordered eating history (tracking can be triggering)

**Option D: Hand portions** (visual method)
- Palm = protein serving (~25-30g)
- Fist = carb serving (~25-30g)
- Thumb = fat serving (~10-15g)
- Fist = vegetable serving

Best for: Those who don't want to weigh food but want structure

**Tracking frequency**: Daily tracking during goal phases. Once you understand portion sizes (after 3-6 months), can shift to rules-based.

### Phase 5: Adjust (Every 2-4 weeks)

Track results and adjust accordingly. Weight alone isn't enough.

**What to track**:
- Weight (same time daily, use 7-day average)
- Progress photos (same lighting, same pose, every 2-4 weeks)
- Measurements (waist, chest, arms, legs - monthly)
- Energy levels (subjective 1-10)
- Training performance (see health:strength-program)
- Hunger levels (sustainable or struggling?)

**Adjustment rules**:

**Fat loss goal but weight not moving** (2+ weeks stalled):
- First: Verify tracking accuracy (weighing food? Logging everything?)
- Then: Reduce calories by 100-200/day
- Or: Add 1-2 cardio sessions per week
- Don't: Slash calories dramatically

**Muscle gain goal but weight not moving**:
- First: Verify eating enough (actually hitting calories?)
- Then: Add 200-300 calories/day
- Focus on: Pre/post workout nutrition

**Losing weight too fast** (>1.5 lbs/week consistently):
- Add 200-300 calories
- Prioritize protein
- Fast loss = muscle loss risk

**Energy levels tanking**:
- Increase carbs (especially around workouts)
- Check sleep (see health:sleep-routine)
- Consider smaller deficit

**Hunger unbearable**:
- Increase protein (most satiating)
- Increase fiber and vegetables (volume without calories)
- Consider diet break (2 weeks at maintenance)

## Disruption Protocols

### Eating Out

**Strategy**: Make reasonable choices, don't stress

**Tactics**:
- Check menu beforehand if possible
- Protein-first (order protein, then sides)
- Ask for dressing/sauce on side
- Skip appetizers or share
- Estimate portions (don't obsess)

**Tracking when eating out**:
- Make best estimate
- Log something reasonable
- Don't use "ate out" as excuse to abandon plan

**The 80/20 reality**: One restaurant meal doesn't matter. Restaurant meals 5 nights a week matters.

### Travel

**Preparation**:
- Pack protein bars/powder
- Research food options at destination
- Accept maintenance mode (not progress)

**Tactics while traveling**:
- Hotel breakfast: eggs, yogurt, fruit
- Airport: look for protein options (skewers, salads, nuts)
- Restaurants: protein + vegetables + reasonable portions

**Returning home**: Immediately back to normal routine. No "I'll start Monday."

### Social Events

**Strategy**: Participate without derailing

**Tactics**:
- Eat protein before arriving (less hungry)
- Survey food options before filling plate
- One reasonable plate, then stop
- Focus on social connection, not the food
- Alcohol: counts as calories, lowers inhibitions for food choices

**The permission slip**: One party doesn't matter. Every weekend being a "cheat weekend" matters.

### Diet Breaks

When to take a planned break:
- After 8-12 weeks of deficit
- Hunger constantly high
- Energy and training suffering
- Psychologically worn out

**How to diet break**:
- Increase to maintenance calories (TDEE)
- Keep protein high
- Duration: 1-2 weeks
- Then resume deficit if goal not reached

**Why diet breaks work**: Metabolic adaptation, hormonal recovery, psychological reset.

## Key Principles

**Framework sources**:
- **ISSN** (International Society of Sports Nutrition) - Evidence-based protein recommendations
- **Examine.com** - Unbiased research summaries
- **Mike Israetel** (Renaissance Periodization) - Diet periodization
- **Precision Nutrition** - Behavior change, sustainable habits

**Core principles**:
1. **Calories determine weight**: Surplus = gain, deficit = loss. Thermodynamics.
2. **Protein is priority**: Preserves muscle, high satiety, harder to overeat
3. **Consistency > Perfection**: 80% adherence sustained beats 100% for 2 weeks
4. **Food quality matters but isn't everything**: Whole foods for health, calories for weight
5. **Sustainability wins**: Any diet works temporarily. Systems last.

**Integration with other health skills**:
- **Sleep → Nutrition**: Poor sleep increases hunger hormones (see health:sleep-routine)
- **Training → Nutrition**: Training drives protein needs (see health:strength-program)
- **The trilogy**: Good nutrition enables training and supports sleep

## Common Pitfalls

**All-or-nothing thinking**: One "bad" meal doesn't ruin the week. Resume normal eating at next meal. No "starting over Monday."

**Not tracking protein**: This is the one macro that matters most. At minimum, know you're hitting protein target.

**Cutting too aggressively**: Large deficits lose muscle, tank energy, increase binge risk. Moderate deficit, patience.

**No meal prep**: Without prep, you make reactive decisions when hungry. Hungry decisions are usually poor decisions.

**Ignoring hunger/fullness cues**: Tracking is a tool, not a prison. If you're truly starving, eat. If you're stuffed, stop.

**Demonizing food groups**: Carbs aren't evil. Fat isn't evil. Context matters. Unless medically necessary, no food group needs elimination.

**Weighing daily and panicking**: Weight fluctuates 2-5 lbs daily (water, food, waste). Use 7-day average, not daily number.

**Perfectionism**: "I can't track perfectly so I won't track at all." Track imperfectly. Close enough works.

**Copying others' diets**: Your friend's macro split might not work for you. Start with general guidelines, adjust for YOUR body.

## Examples

**Example 1: Fat loss phase with full tracking**

**Situation**: 200 lb person, lightly active, wants to lose 20 lbs for health.

**Setup**:
- Maintenance: 200 x 14 = 2,800 calories
- Target: 2,300 calories (500 deficit)
- Protein: 160g (0.8g/lb)
- Fat: 70g (minimum)
- Carbs: 200g (remaining)

**Weekly rhythm**:
- Sunday: Plan meals, grocery shop, 2-hour prep
- Daily: Log in MyFitnessPal, hit protein first
- Weigh daily, review 7-day average on Sunday

**After 8 weeks**: Down 8 lbs, energy good. Continue.

**After 16 weeks**: Down 18 lbs, hunger increasing. Take 2-week diet break at maintenance.

**After 20 weeks**: Goal reached. Transition to maintenance calories.

**Example 2: Simple rules approach for maintenance**

**Situation**: Hit goal weight, burned out on tracking, wants sustainable approach.

**Rules adopted**:
- Protein every meal (palm-sized minimum)
- Half plate vegetables at lunch and dinner
- Eat until 80% full, stop
- One intentional treat daily (not reactive)
- Alcohol max 2 drinks, max 2 nights/week

**Weekly rhythm**:
- Sunday: Light prep (cook chicken, prep veggies)
- Daily: Follow rules, no logging
- Weigh weekly, adjust only if trending

**Result**: Weight maintained within 3 lbs for 6+ months. No tracking fatigue.

---

**Example 3: Building muscle (lean bulk)**

**Situation**: 165 lb person, training 4x/week, wants to build muscle without excessive fat gain.

**Setup**:
- Maintenance: 165 x 16 = 2,640 calories (very active)
- Target: 2,900 calories (+260 surplus)
- Protein: 165g (1g/lb)
- Fat: 65g
- Carbs: 350g (higher for training fuel)

**Focus areas**:
- Pre-workout meal: carbs + protein 2 hours before
- Post-workout: protein shake immediately after
- Overall: slight surplus, high protein, track lifts progressing

**After 12 weeks**: Weight up 5 lbs, lifts progressing well, minimal fat gain. Continue.

---

**Example 4: Integration with sleep and strength**

**Full day example**:

6:30am - Wake (sleep-routine)
- Hydrate

7:00am - Breakfast
- 3 eggs, toast, fruit
- ~35g protein

9:00am - Coffee (delayed per sleep-routine)

12:30pm - Lunch (meal prepped)
- Chicken breast (prepped Sunday), rice, roasted vegetables
- ~45g protein

3:30pm - Pre-workout snack
- Greek yogurt + banana
- ~20g protein

5:00pm - Strength training (strength-program)

6:30pm - Post-workout dinner
- Salmon, sweet potato, asparagus
- Protein shake if didn't hit target
- ~50g protein

8:30pm - Wind-down starts (sleep-routine)
- Light snack if calories allow

Daily total: ~2,400 calories, ~150g protein

**Why integration works**: Nutrition fuels training, training drives protein needs, sleep enables recovery from both. The three skills reinforce each other.
