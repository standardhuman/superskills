# Strength Program

## Overview

Evidence-based approach to building strength and muscle through progressive overload, compound movements, and systematic tracking. This skill helps you choose a program, execute it consistently, and handle plateaus and disruptions.

**When to use**: Starting a lifting program, stalling on progress, returning after a break, designing workout routine

**Key insight**: Progressive overload is the only thing that matters for building strength. Everything else serves that goal. Add weight to the bar over time, and you will get stronger.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Action | Frequency |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1. Program Selection | Choose appropriate program | Once (then stick to it) |
| 2. Session Execution | Follow the workout | 3-4x per week |
| 3. Tracking | Log every set | Every session |
| 4. Progression | Add weight per program rules | Weekly or as prescribed |
| 5. Deload | Planned recovery week | Every 4-8 weeks |
| 6. Plateau Handling | Adjust when progress stalls | As needed |

**Core principle**: Run ONE program for at least 12 weeks before evaluating.

## The Process

### Phase 1: Program Selection

Choose a program based on your experience level. Don't overthink this.

**Beginner (0-12 months of consistent lifting)**:
Programs with linear progression (add weight every session):

| Program | Days/Week | Focus | Best For |
|---------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Starting Strength | 3 | Pure strength | True beginners |
| StrongLifts 5x5 | 3 | Strength + volume | Beginners wanting simplicity |
| GZCLP | 3-4 | Balanced | Those wanting structure |

**Intermediate (1-3 years)**:
Programs with weekly progression or periodization:

| Program | Days/Week | Focus | Best For |
|---------|-----------|-------|----------|
| 5/3/1 | 3-4 | Long-term progress | Sustainable gains |
| GZCL Method | 3-4 | Flexible structure | Customization needed |
| PPL (Push/Pull/Legs) | 6 | Volume + frequency | Hypertrophy focus |

**Advanced (3+ years)**:
Seek coaching or design custom programming. Beyond this skill's scope.

**The selection rule**: Pick one. Run it for 12 weeks minimum. Don't modify it. The program works if you work the program.

**AskUserQuestion**: "What's your lifting experience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)? How many days per week can you train?"

### Phase 2: Session Execution

How to actually do a workout.

**Pre-workout checklist**:
- [ ] Know today's exercises (looked at program)
- [ ] Know target weights (from last session's log)
- [ ] Ate 1-2 hours ago (see health:nutrition-planning)
- [ ] Slept adequately (see health:sleep-routine)
- [ ] Phone in gym bag (not in hand)

**Warm-up protocol** (10-15 minutes):
1. General: 5 min light cardio (bike, walk, row)
2. Dynamic stretching: Leg swings, arm circles, hip circles
3. Movement prep: Empty bar or light weight for first exercise
4. Ramp-up sets:
   - Set 1: 40% of working weight x 8 reps
   - Set 2: 60% of working weight x 5 reps
   - Set 3: 80% of working weight x 3 reps
   - Then: Working sets

**During working sets**:
- Focus on form, not ego
- Full range of motion
- Controlled tempo (don't bounce weight)
- Rest 2-5 min between heavy compound sets
- Rest 1-2 min between accessory exercises

**The compound lifts** (these should be your focus):
| Lift | Primary Muscles |
|------|-----------------|
| Squat | Quads, glutes, core |
| Deadlift | Posterior chain, back, grip |
| Bench Press | Chest, shoulders, triceps |
| Overhead Press | Shoulders, triceps, core |
| Row | Back, biceps, rear delts |
| Pull-up/Chin-up | Back, biceps |

**Form priority**: Never sacrifice form for weight. Bad form = injury risk + less effective. If form breaks, reduce weight.

### Phase 3: Tracking

If you're not tracking, you're guessing. Guessing doesn't produce progress.

**What to track** (every session):
- Date
- Exercise name
- Sets x Reps x Weight
- RPE (optional but useful - Rate of Perceived Exertion 1-10)
- Notes (form issues, felt strong/weak, etc.)

**Tracking methods**:
- Simple: Notebook and pen
- App: Strong, JEFIT, Hevy, or your program's app
- Spreadsheet: Google Sheets template

**Example log entry**:
```
Monday, Jan 15
Squat: 135x5, 165x5, 185x5x3 (3 working sets of 5 at 185)
  RPE 7 - felt solid, depth good
Bench: 95x5, 115x5, 135x5x3
  RPE 8 - last rep of last set was a grind
Row: 95x8x3
  Form broke down on set 3, dropped to 85
```

**Why tracking matters**:
- Know what weight to use next time (no "what did I do last week?")
- See progress over weeks/months (motivating)
- Identify patterns (tired on Fridays, strong on Mondays)
- Know when you've plateaued (no guessing)

### Phase 4: Progression

How to add weight over time (the actual goal).

**Linear progression** (beginners):
- Add weight every session you complete all prescribed reps
- Typical increases: 5 lbs squat/deadlift, 2.5 lbs bench/press
- If you fail reps, repeat same weight next session
- If you fail same weight twice, deload (see Phase 5)

**Weekly progression** (intermediate):
- Add weight weekly instead of every session
- Example: 5/3/1 adds 5-10 lbs per cycle (3-4 weeks)
- Slower but sustainable long-term

**The progression rule**: Only increase weight when you've completed all prescribed reps with good form. Never sacrifice form for progression.

**Microplates**: Buy 1.25 lb plates. Gyms rarely have them. Essential for pressing movements where 5 lb jumps are too big.

### Phase 5: Deload

Planned recovery weeks. Not optional.

**When to deload**:
- Every 4-8 weeks (program should specify)
- After 2-3 failed sessions in a row
- When joints ache (not muscle soreness - joint pain)
- After high-stress life periods

**How to deload**:
- Reduce weight by 40-50%
- Keep same exercises and sets
- OR reduce volume (fewer sets, same weight)
- Still go to gym (habit maintenance)
- Duration: 1 week

**Why deloads work**: Fatigue accumulates. Deloads let fatigue dissipate while fitness is retained. You come back stronger.

**Common mistake**: Skipping deloads because you "feel fine." Accumulated fatigue isn't always obvious until you crash.

### Phase 6: Plateau Handling

When progress stalls despite consistent effort.

**First: Diagnose the cause**:

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Failing same weight 3+ times | Fatigue or program needs change | Deload then retry, or reset |
| Every lift stalling | Recovery issue | Check sleep, nutrition, stress |
| One lift stalling | Form or weakness | Video form, add accessory work |
| Feeling burnt out | Overtraining | Extended deload (2 weeks) |

**The reset protocol** (when deload doesn't fix it):
1. Take 1 week deload
2. Reduce training max by 10%
3. Build back up
4. This gives you "runway" to progress again

**When to switch programs**:
- After 12+ weeks with no progress despite resets
- When life circumstances change (fewer training days)
- Never switch because you're bored or saw something "better"

**The program hopping trap**: Beginners especially switch programs constantly, never giving any program time to work. Stick to one for at least 12 weeks.

## Disruption Protocols

### Travel

**Short trip (1-4 days)**:
- Skip gym entirely - rest days
- Light movement if desired (walk, hotel bodyweight)
- Resume normal program on return

**Longer trip (1+ week)**:
- Find gym or use hotel equipment
- Reduce volume but maintain intensity
- Focus on compound movements only
- Accept maintenance, not progress

**Returning after break**:
- First week: 50% of previous weights
- Second week: 70-80% of previous weights
- Third week: Attempt previous weights
- Muscle memory is real - it comes back fast

### Injury

**Rule 1**: Work around it, not through it

- Lower body injury → Train upper body
- Upper body injury → Train lower body and core
- If movement hurts, DON'T DO IT

**Rule 2**: See a professional if pain persists

- Sharp pain during movement = stop immediately
- Dull ache that improves with warm-up = usually okay
- Pain that gets worse over sessions = see doctor/physio

**Returning from injury**:
- Start at 50% of pre-injury weight
- Progress slowly (no ego)
- If pain returns, back off

### Life Stress

When life is overwhelming:

**Minimum effective dose**:
- 2 days per week (down from 3-4)
- Compound lifts only (squat, bench, deadlift, row)
- 2 working sets instead of 3-4
- Maintain, don't progress

**Why this works**: Some stimulus beats no stimulus. Habit is maintained. You don't lose much in 2-4 weeks of reduced volume.

## Key Principles

**Framework sources**:
- **Mark Rippetoe** (Starting Strength) - Beginner programming, compound lift priority
- **Jim Wendler** (5/3/1) - Sustainable long-term progression, training max concept
- **Mike Israetel** (Renaissance Periodization) - Volume landmarks, fatigue management
- **Greg Nuckols** (Stronger By Science) - Evidence-based programming principles

**Core principles**:
1. **Progressive overload**: More weight over time = more strength. Period.
2. **Compound movements**: Squat, deadlift, bench, press, row. These are 90% of the game.
3. **Consistency > Intensity**: 3 mediocre sessions beat 1 heroic session
4. **Recovery = Training**: Sleep and nutrition make the adaptation happen (see sister skills)
5. **Patience**: Strength takes years to build. No shortcuts.

**Integration with other health skills**:
- **Sleep**: Recovery happens during sleep. Poor sleep = poor gains. (See health:sleep-routine)
- **Nutrition**: Protein builds muscle. Calories fuel training. (See health:nutrition-planning)
- **The trilogy**: Sleep + nutrition + consistent training = results

## Common Pitfalls

**Program hopping**: Switching programs every 4 weeks because you saw something new. Programs work over months, not weeks. Pick one, run it for 12+ weeks.

**No tracking**: "I think I did 135 last week?" means you're guessing. Guessing produces random results. Track everything.

**Ego lifting**: Sacrificing form for heavier weight. Your 1RM doesn't matter if you're injured. Form first, always.

**Skipping deloads**: "I feel fine" until you don't. Fatigue accumulates invisibly. Planned deloads prevent forced deloads from injury or burnout.

**Ignoring recovery**: Training is the stimulus; recovery is when you get stronger. Training harder without sleeping and eating is spinning wheels.

**Too much variety**: Chasing the pump with 15 different exercises. The basics work. Do them consistently.

**Cardio paranoia**: Light cardio doesn't kill gains. 20-30 min walking helps recovery. Extreme endurance training competes with strength, but moderate cardio supports it.

**Waiting for motivation**: Motivation fades. Systems persist. Go to the gym because it's Tuesday and Tuesday is gym day.

## Examples

**Example 1: True beginner starting out**

**Situation**: Never lifted weights. Intimidated by gym. Doesn't know where to start.

**Program selected**: Starting Strength (3 days/week)

**Week 1**:
- Day 1: Squat 45lb (empty bar), Bench 45lb, Deadlift 65lb
- Focus: Learning movement patterns
- Trainer or app for form check

**Week 4**:
- Squat 95lb, Bench 65lb, Deadlift 115lb
- Adding 5lb per session successfully
- Form improving, confidence building

**Week 12**:
- Squat 165lb, Bench 105lb, Deadlift 185lb
- First plateau on bench - repeated weight, then progressed
- Hooked on lifting

**Key insight**: Starting light feels pointless but allows form development and consistent progression.

**Example 2: Intermediate lifter returning after break**

**Situation**: Lifted for 2 years, took 6 months off for work project. Previous maxes: Squat 275, Bench 185, Deadlift 315.

**Return protocol**:
- Week 1: 50% weights (Squat 135, Bench 95, Deadlift 155)
- Week 2: 70% weights (Squat 195, Bench 130, Deadlift 225)
- Week 3: 85% weights (Squat 235, Bench 160, Deadlift 275)
- Week 4: Test previous weights

**Result**: Reached previous strength in 6 weeks (muscle memory). Chose 5/3/1 for sustainable long-term progress instead of aggressive linear progression.

**Key insight**: Patience on return prevents injury. Muscle memory works.

**Example 3: Busy professional on minimum dose**

**Situation**: Can only train 2x per week due to work/family. Still wants to maintain and slowly progress.

**Program adapted**: 2-day full body

**Day A**:
- Squat 3x5
- Bench 3x5
- Row 3x8

**Day B**:
- Deadlift 3x5
- Overhead Press 3x5
- Pull-ups 3x max

**Progression**: Weekly (+5lb squat/DL, +2.5lb press/bench)

**Result**: Slower progress than 3-4 days, but sustainable. Maintains strength during busy season. Scales up when life allows.

**Key insight**: Minimum effective dose beats zero dose.

**Example 4: Integration with sleep and nutrition**

**The system in action**:

Morning:
- Wake 6:30am, morning light (sleep-routine)
- Protein-rich breakfast (nutrition-planning)

Training day (e.g., 5pm):
- Pre-workout meal 2-3 hours before (nutrition-planning)
- Strength session: squat, bench, row
- Log everything (strength-program tracking)
- Post-workout protein within 2 hours (nutrition-planning)

Evening:
- Adequate calories consumed for recovery (nutrition-planning)
- Wind-down routine starts 9pm (sleep-routine)
- Lights out 10:30pm (sleep-routine)

Sleep:
- Recovery happens now
- Growth hormone peaks during deep sleep
- Muscle protein synthesis continuing

Next day:
- Wake rested (sleep-routine worked)
- Can train again or recover (depending on program)

**Why integration works**: Training without sleep/nutrition is stimulus without recovery. All three skills work together as a system.
