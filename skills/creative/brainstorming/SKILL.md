# Creative Brainstorming

## Overview

Structured creative thinking process that combines SCAMPER, lateral thinking, and Design Thinking to generate innovative solutions. Moves beyond "let's just think of ideas" to systematic exploration that produces actionable, novel approaches.

**When to use**: Stuck on a problem, need fresh perspectives, designing something new, exploring product ideas, reframing challenges, before starting major projects

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Action | Time |
|-------|--------|------|
| 1. Define | Clarify the real problem | 10 min |
| 2. Diverge | Generate wide range of ideas | 20 min |
| 3. Explore | Apply SCAMPER techniques | 15 min |
| 4. Connect | Find unexpected combinations | 10 min |
| 5. Converge | Select and refine top ideas | 15 min |

**Total time**: ~60-70 minutes

## The Process

Copy this checklist using TodoWrite to track progress:

```
□ Phase 1: Define (clarify problem)
□ Phase 2: Diverge (generate ideas)
□ Phase 3: Explore (apply SCAMPER)
□ Phase 4: Connect (find combinations)
□ Phase 5: Converge (select and refine)
```

### Phase 1: Define (10 minutes)

Clarify what you're actually trying to solve. The problem you start with is rarely the real problem.

**Actions**:
1. Write down the problem as you currently understand it
2. Ask: "What is this really about?" (go deeper 3 times)
3. Reframe as "How might we..." questions
4. Identify constraints (budget, time, technology, people)
5. Define success: What would a great outcome look like?

**AskUserQuestion**: "What problem are you trying to solve? What would success look like?"

**Why this matters**: Einstein said "If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes on solutions." Most brainstorming fails because it solves the wrong problem.

**Example reframing**:
- "We need a better website" → "How might we help customers find what they need faster?"
- "I need more time" → "How might we accomplish the same outcome with different resources?"
- "Our app needs more features" → "How might we deliver more value with what we already have?"

### Phase 2: Diverge (20 minutes)

Generate quantity without judgment. Separate idea generation from idea evaluation.

**Actions**:
1. Set a timer for 20 minutes
2. Generate ideas rapidly without stopping to evaluate
3. Write every idea, no matter how wild
4. Aim for 30+ ideas minimum (quantity breeds quality)
5. When stuck, use these prompts:
   - "What would this look like if we had unlimited budget?"
   - "What would a child suggest?"
   - "What would be the opposite approach?"
   - "What would [person you admire] do?"

**Rules for divergence**:
- No criticism (not even "yeah, but...")
- Build on others' ideas ("yes, and...")
- Wild ideas welcome (easier to tame than to invigorate)
- Stay focused on topic (tangents kill momentum)
- Defer judgment (evaluation comes later)

**Tool**: Use AskUserQuestion to prompt additional ideas when momentum slows

**Why separate diverge/converge**: Your brain can't create and judge simultaneously. When you evaluate while generating, you shut down the creative process before it has a chance to produce truly novel ideas.

### Phase 3: Explore (15 minutes)

Apply SCAMPER technique to systematically explore variations.

**SCAMPER Framework**:

**S - Substitute**: What could you replace? Materials, processes, people, places?
- "Instead of X, what if we used Y?"
- "What if someone else did this part?"

**C - Combine**: What could you merge? Features, ideas, resources?
- "What if we combined [idea A] with [idea B]?"
- "What partnerships or integrations make sense?"

**A - Adapt**: What else is like this? What could you copy or adjust?
- "Who else solved a similar problem differently?"
- "What works in another industry that we could adapt?"

**M - Modify**: What could you change? Scale, shape, attributes, meaning?
- "What if this was bigger/smaller/faster/slower?"
- "What if we exaggerated or minimized a key feature?"

**P - Put to other uses**: What else could this be used for? Other markets, purposes?
- "Who else might benefit from this?"
- "What other problems does this solution solve?"

**E - Eliminate**: What could you remove? Simplify, subtract, reduce?
- "What if we removed the most obvious feature?"
- "What's the absolute minimum version?"

**R - Reverse/Rearrange**: What if you did it backwards? Changed the order?
- "What if customers came to us instead of us going to them?"
- "What if we did step 3 before step 1?"

**Action**: Pick your 5 most promising ideas from Phase 2 and apply each SCAMPER element to them. This typically generates 15-30 new variations.

### Phase 4: Connect (10 minutes)

Find unexpected combinations and cross-pollinate ideas.

**Actions**:
1. Review all ideas generated (Phase 2 + Phase 3)
2. Look for ideas that could be combined
3. Apply "forced connections": randomly pair ideas and ask "how could these work together?"
4. Identify themes or patterns emerging across ideas
5. Ask: "What's the idea behind the idea?" (abstract to principles)

**Lateral thinking prompts**:
- "What if we did both [opposite ideas] at the same time?"
- "What's the common element in these three different ideas?"
- "If we couldn't do any of these, what would we do instead?"

**Tool**: Use AskUserQuestion to explore surprising connections

**Why this works**: Innovation often happens at the intersection of existing ideas. The iPhone wasn't invented from scratch - it combined phone + iPod + internet into one device.

### Phase 5: Converge (15 minutes)

Select and refine the most promising ideas using clear criteria.

**Selection criteria**:
1. **Impact**: How much does this improve the situation?
2. **Feasibility**: Can we actually do this with our constraints?
3. **Novel**: Is this different from existing approaches?
4. **Aligned**: Does this fit our goals and values?

**Actions**:
1. Review all ideas quickly (scan, don't analyze deeply yet)
2. Mark ideas that feel promising (gut check first)
3. Apply selection criteria to marked ideas
4. Select top 3 ideas for deeper refinement
5. For each top idea, answer:
   - What's the core insight?
   - What's the first step to test it?
   - What would need to be true for this to work?
   - What's the biggest risk/assumption?

**AskUserQuestion with structured evaluation**: "Let's evaluate your ideas against impact, feasibility, and novelty."

**Deliverable**: 3 refined ideas with:
- Clear description (elevator pitch)
- Key benefits
- First next action to test/validate
- Major assumptions to test

## Key Principles

**Source**: Combined framework drawing from:
- **SCAMPER** (Bob Eberle, 1971) - Systematic idea generation technique
- **Design Thinking** (IDEO, Stanford d.school) - Human-centered innovation process
- **Lateral Thinking** (Edward de Bono, 1967) - Indirect problem-solving approaches
- **Divergent/Convergent Thinking** (J.P. Guilford, 1950s) - Separate generation from evaluation

**Why it works**:
- **Structured creativity**: Framework prevents blank-page paralysis while allowing wild ideas
- **Psychological safety**: Explicit "no judgment" phase makes it safe to suggest bold ideas
- **Systematic exploration**: SCAMPER ensures you don't miss obvious variations
- **Forced connections**: Lateral thinking techniques break habitual thought patterns
- **Clear criteria**: Converge phase prevents either (a) choosing first idea or (b) analysis paralysis

**The innovation equation**: Novel ideas = (Diverse inputs) × (Systematic exploration) × (Judgment-free generation)

**Design Thinking principle**: "Fall in love with the problem, not your first solution." Spend time understanding before solving.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Jumping to solutions too quickly**: "I already know what we should do" skips the exploration that finds better ideas. Even if your first instinct is right, exploring alternatives helps you understand why it's right and how to improve it.

- **Evaluating during divergence**: "That won't work because..." Your inner critic kills creativity before it has a chance. Separate generation from evaluation. Even "bad" ideas can spark great ones if you let them exist without immediate judgment.

- **Stopping at obvious ideas**: The first 10 ideas are usually variations of what already exists. Innovation lives in ideas 20-40. Keep pushing past the obvious.

- **Working alone when you need diverse perspectives**: Your brain has patterns and blind spots. Other people see different possibilities. Even one other person dramatically increases idea quality (different backgrounds/expertise is better).

- **Solving the wrong problem**: Spent 60 minutes generating brilliant solutions to a problem nobody has. Phase 1 (Define) prevents this - don't skip it.

- **No follow-through**: Brainstorming that doesn't lead to action is just daydreaming. Phase 5 must end with clear next steps, even if it's just "build a quick prototype to test assumption X."

- **Forgetting constraints**: "We should build a rocket ship!" Cool, but you have $5K and 2 weeks. Constraints aren't creativity-killers, they're creativity-focusers. Define them in Phase 1.

## Examples

**Example 1: SaaS company struggling with customer onboarding**

**Phase 1 - Define**:
- Initial problem: "Users don't complete onboarding"
- Reframe after 3 "whys": "How might we help users experience value before they hit friction?"
- Success criteria: 60% of users reach "aha moment" within first session

**Phase 2 - Diverge**:
- Generated 47 ideas including: video tutorials, interactive demos, AI chatbot, remove signup entirely, one-on-one calls, gamification, shorter forms, email drip, etc.

**Phase 3 - Explore (SCAMPER)**:
- **Substitute**: What if we replaced form with conversation? (chatbot collecting info naturally)
- **Eliminate**: What if we removed onboarding entirely? (let them use product immediately, collect info over time)
- **Reverse**: What if product onboarded to user instead? (AI learns their needs by watching first actions)

**Phase 4 - Connect**:
- Combined: "Eliminate onboarding + product learns from actions + conversation when needed"
- Insight: Best onboarding is no onboarding - get to value immediately

**Phase 5 - Converge**:
- Top idea: Let users start using core feature immediately (no signup), system learns preferences from usage, prompts for account creation only when they need to save work
- First step: Build prototype with anonymous session that prompts for signup when user clicks "save"
- Assumption to test: Will users actually create account after using product, or will they bounce?

**Outcome**: Built and tested in 2 weeks, increased completion rate from 35% to 61%

**Example 2: Content creator feeling burnout**

**Phase 1 - Define**:
- Initial: "I need to make more content"
- Reframe: "How might I create more value with less energy?"
- Success: Maintain audience growth while working 50% less time

**Phase 2 - Diverge**:
- 38 ideas including: batch creation, hire editor, repurpose content, go live instead of editing, create templates, reduce frequency, collaborate with others, teach others to create, build community that creates content

**Phase 3 - Explore (SCAMPER)**:
- **Combine**: What if I combined my content with other creators? (guest swapping, co-creation)
- **Put to other uses**: What if my audience created the content? (community-generated, I curate)
- **Modify**: What if each piece was 10x shorter? (threads instead of essays)

**Phase 4 - Connect**:
- Pattern emerging: "Leverage others" appeared in multiple forms
- Combined: Community creates content, I curate/comment/add perspective, turns into collaborative resource

**Phase 5 - Converge**:
- Top idea: Weekly thread where community shares their insights on topic, I compile best ones with commentary into newsletter
- First step: Post question to audience this Friday, compile responses over weekend
- Assumption to test: Will audience participate? Will this be valuable to readers?

**Outcome**: First experiment got 43 responses, compiled newsletter had 2x normal engagement, now sustainable weekly format

**Example 3: Developer stuck on performance problem**

**Phase 1 - Define**:
- Initial: "This database query is slow"
- Reframe: "How might we deliver this information to users faster?"
- Success: Sub-200ms response time for 95th percentile

**Phase 2 - Diverge**:
- 29 ideas: optimize query, add indexes, cache results, precompute data, change database, denormalize, use CDN, reduce data requested, infinite scroll instead of pagination, show stale data with refresh, move to edge, etc.

**Phase 3 - Explore (SCAMPER)**:
- **Eliminate**: What if we didn't query database at all? (serve from cache or precomputed)
- **Reverse**: What if we pushed updates to client instead of client pulling? (websockets, server-sent events)
- **Adapt**: How do social media feeds handle this? (they serve cached/precomputed data, compute in background)

**Phase 4 - Connect**:
- Pattern: Multiple ideas involved "don't compute on request"
- Combined: Precompute data on write operations, serve from fast cache, background job updates cache

**Phase 5 - Converge**:
- Top idea: Move computation from read-time to write-time (when user saves data, trigger background job to update all affected cache entries)
- First step: Add background job that precomputes one piece of data, measure impact
- Assumption to test: Write operations are infrequent enough that we can afford more processing there

**Outcome**: Reduced query time from 1200ms to 45ms, moved complexity to write-time where it's less noticeable
