# Daily Startup

## Overview

Beginning-of-day ritual to start work with intention, clarity, and energy. Complements the daily-shutdown ritual. Takes 15-20 minutes but transforms how you enter the workday - from reactive scrambling to intentional execution.

**When to use**: Start of workday, after morning routine, before diving into work

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Action | Time |
|-------|--------|------|
| 0. Prepare (optional) | Holistic readiness check | 5-10 min |
| 1. Launch | Startup ritual (begin work mode) | 2 min |
| 2. Review | Check today's plan & calendar | 3 min |
| 3. Prime | Energy check & intention setting | 3 min |
| 4. Focus | Time-block the day | 5 min |
| 5. Execute | Start deep work on Priority #1 | immediate |

**Total time**: 10-15 minutes (core) or 15-25 minutes (with Phase 0)

## The Process

### Phase 0: Prepare (Optional/Flexible - 5-10 minutes)

Holistic readiness check - body, mind, emotional state. Some days need more, some days less.

**Physical**:
- Coffee/tea prepared
- Light movement or stretch
- Hydrated, fed appropriately
- Ready to sit and focus

**Mental/Emotional** (optional self-connection):
- How am I feeling right now?
- What do I need today?
- Brief meditation or breathing (2-3 min)
- If strong emotions present, consider using inner:self-connection skill

**Spiritual/Intention** (if this resonates):
- Gratitude (name 3 things)
- Purpose reminder (why does today's work matter?)
- Centering practice

**Why Phase 0 matters**: You're a whole person, not just a task-execution machine. Starting from depletion or reactivity sets the tone for the whole day.

**Flexibility**: Adjust based on need. Some days this is 10 minutes, some days it's 2 minutes. Listen to what you need.

### Phase 1: Launch (2 minutes)

Ritual to signal "work mode begins now."

**Choose your startup ritual** (reverse of shutdown ritual):

**Option A: Spoken affirmation**
Say out loud: "Work begins now. I'm ready and focused."

**Option B: Physical action**
- Open laptop with intention
- Turn on desk lamp
- Enter workspace (if WFH)
- Put on "work" playlist

**Option C: Transition activity**
- Sit at desk and take 3 deep breaths
- Review mission/purpose statement
- Light candle or ritual object

**Why ritual works**: Clear signal to brain that work mode is active. Creates psychological boundary between "morning routine" and "work time."

**AskUserQuestion**: "What ritual will signal 'work has begun' for you?"

### Phase 2: Review (3 minutes)

Check today's plan (which you set last night in daily-shutdown).

**Actions**:
1. Look at the 3 priorities you set yesterday evening
2. Check today's calendar for meetings/commitments
3. Scan for any overnight urgents (email subject lines only, don't read yet)
4. Verify: Are today's priorities still the right priorities?

**Adjustment rule**: If overnight urgents change priorities, update the list. But be honest about "urgent" vs "just loud."

**Tomorrow morning test from shutdown**: With yesterday's plan, can you start immediately? If yes, your shutdown worked. If no, note what was missing.

### Phase 3: Prime (3 minutes)

Energy check and intention setting.

**Energy assessment**:
- Rate your energy 1-10 right now
- If <7, acknowledge that and adjust expectations
- Plan your day around your energy (high-energy tasks when fresh)

**Set daily intention**:
- "Today I'm focusing on..."
- "Success today looks like..."
- "My theme/approach for today is..." (e.g., "steady progress" or "bold action")

**Quick wins strategy** (optional):
- Start with 5-minute easy task to build momentum?
- Or dive straight into deep work?
- Match strategy to your energy and personality

**AskUserQuestion**: "What's your energy level (1-10) and daily intention?"

### Phase 4: Focus (5 minutes)

Time-block your day to protect priorities.

**Actions**:
1. Open calendar
2. For each of your top 3 priorities, schedule a specific time block:
   - Priority #1: When? (Ideally first thing, or when you're freshest)
   - Priority #2: When?
   - Priority #3: When?
3. Schedule breaks (every 90 min)
4. Leave buffer time (unexpected issues)
5. **Protect Priority #1**: Block it before anything else can claim that time

**The 80% rule**: Only schedule 80% of your time. Leave 20% for the unexpected.

**Email/reactive time**: Schedule this AFTER priority work, not before.

### Phase 5: Execute (Immediate)

Start deep work on Priority #1 immediately. No delay.

**Actions**:
1. Close email
2. Close Slack/chat
3. Phone on Do Not Disturb
4. Open whatever you need for Priority #1
5. Set timer (if using Pomodoro)
6. START

**The key**: Execute before you talk yourself out of it. The startup ritual creates momentum - use it immediately.

**Why Priority #1 goes first**: If you check email or messages first, you're starting in reactive mode. Someone else sets your agenda. Priority #1 first means YOU set the agenda.

## Key Principles

**Source**: Combined framework from:
- **Cal Newport's "Deep Work"** - Startup complements shutdown ritual, protects deep work
- **David Allen's GTD** - Review and engage (weekly review scales down to daily)
- **Tony Schwartz's "The Power of Full Engagement"** - Energy management (match tasks to energy)
- **James Clear's "Atomic Habits"** - Ritual stacking (startup ritual becomes automatic trigger)

**Why it works**:
- **Ritual creates trigger**: Brain learns "this ritual = focused work mode"
- **Review prevents scrambling**: You know what to do from minute one
- **Priming sets intention**: Conscious choice vs. reactive drift
- **Time-blocking protects priorities**: Scheduled time is protected time
- **Starting with Priority #1**: Proactive mode vs. reactive mode

**Core insight**: Most people start the day in reactive mode (email, messages, whatever's loudest). Daily startup flips this - you start in execution mode on what matters most.

**Connection to shutdown**: Yesterday evening's shutdown sets today's priorities. This morning's startup executes them. They work together as a system.

## Common Pitfalls

- **"I'll just check email first"**: This is how Priority #1 never happens. Email is infinite. Priority #1 goes first, always. Email after.

- **Skipping on "busy" days**: The busier the day, the more you need the startup ritual. 15 minutes of planning saves 2 hours of thrashing.

- **No actual ritual**: "I'll just start working" leaves you in ambiguous state. Brain needs clear signal. Pick a ritual and do it every day.

- **Ignoring energy levels**: Trying to force deep focus when you're at 3/10 energy sets you up for failure. Acknowledge energy and adjust.

- **Too many priorities**: If you have 8 priorities today, you haven't prioritized. Pick 3. Be ruthless.

- **Not time-blocking**: "I'll work on it when I have time" = it won't happen. Schedule it or it gets crowded out.

- **Treating Phase 0 as indulgent**: Taking care of your whole self isn't optional or indulgent - it's foundational. You can't think clearly while depleted.

- **Starting in reactive mode**: Checking messages before setting intention hands control to other people. You start reacting instead of executing.

## Examples

**Example 1: Software engineer eliminating morning scramble**

**Before daily startup**:
- Arrives at desk, checks Slack
- Sees 15 messages, starts responding
- Looks at email, finds "urgent" request
- 2 hours gone, hasn't started actual work
- Feels behind all day

**After implementing daily startup**:
- 15-minute startup ritual at 9am
- Reviews yesterday's priorities (set in shutdown)
- Energy check: 7/10, good
- Time-blocks: Priority #1 at 9:15am (2 hours deep work)
- Closes Slack, starts coding
- Email checked at 11:30am (after deep work done)

**Result**:
- Priority work happens every morning
- Feels proactive vs. reactive
- Messages still get answered, but AFTER important work

**Key insight**: Starting in execution mode vs. reactive mode completely changes the day's trajectory.

**Example 2: Consultant with variable energy**

**Situation**: Some days high energy, some days low. Was trying to force same schedule every day.

**Startup ritual adapted for energy**:
- Phase 3 (Prime): Honest energy assessment
- High energy days (8+): Tackle hardest problem first
- Medium energy days (5-7): Warm up with easier task, then hard problem
- Low energy days (<5): Focus on admin/planning, reschedule deep work

**Result**:
- Stopped fighting against energy levels
- More consistent output (working WITH energy, not against it)
- Less guilt on low-energy days (still productive, just different tasks)

**Key insight**: Daily startup ritual adapted to energy produces better results than rigid same-every-day approach.

**Example 3: Remote worker creating work/life boundary**

**Before**:
- Rolled out of bed, opened laptop
- "Sort of working" from 8am but not really focused
- No clear start to work day
- Work and personal time blurred

**Startup ritual chosen**:
1. Phase 0: Coffee, 5-min meditation, get dressed (yes, out of pajamas)
2. Phase 1: Walk to "home office," light candle on desk, say "work begins"
3. Phases 2-5: Standard startup ritual
4. Start Priority #1 immediately

**Result**:
- Clear psychological boundary: "now I'm working"
- More focused during work hours
- Easier to end work day (using shutdown ritual)
- Paradoxically working fewer hours but accomplishing more

**Insight**: Remote work needs artificial boundaries. Startup ritual creates the "commute" that signals work mode.

**Example 4: Pairing shutdown & startup together**

**The system**:
- **Yesterday 5pm**: Shutdown ritual sets today's 3 priorities
- **Today 9am**: Startup ritual reviews those priorities and executes

**What this looks like**:
- Yesterday evening: "Tomorrow's top 3 are: ship feature, team 1:1s, architecture planning"
- This morning: Reviews the list, confirms still accurate, time-blocks each, starts on #1

**Result**: Zero morning decision fatigue. Yesterday-you decided, today-you executes. They work as a team.

**The compound effect**: After 2 weeks of shutdown→startup cycle, mornings transform from "what should I do?" to "executing what I already decided."
