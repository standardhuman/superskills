# Philosophy

## Core Principle

**Skills prevent failure modes through proven workflows.**

Just as superpowers prevents engineering anti-patterns through rigorous workflows (TDD, systematic debugging, verification before completion), Life Skills prevents common failure modes in other life domains through structured, actionable practices.

## Why This Approach Works

### 1. Workflows Over Principles

**Principle-based** (doesn't work):
- "Be mindful of your emotions"
- "Communicate with empathy"
- "Plan your week"

**Workflow-based** (works):
- Emotion processing: Notice → Welcome → Inquire → Respond (4 specific steps)
- NVC conversation: Self-connection → Observation → Feeling → Need → Request (5 specific steps)
- Weekly review: Collect → Process → Review → Plan → Complete (5 phases with substeps)

**Why workflows win:**
- Actionable (you know exactly what to do)
- Replicable (same process every time)
- Learnable (build skill through repetition)
- Debuggable (can identify where process broke down)

### 2. Grounded in Proven Frameworks

We don't invent. We systematize.

Every skill is based on an established methodology:
- GTD (Getting Things Done) for productivity
- NVC (Nonviolent Communication) for interpersonal skills
- Atomic Habits for habit formation
- Somatic experiencing for emotional work
- Research methods from academic tradition

**Why this matters:**
- Standing on giants' shoulders
- Decades of refinement already done
- Theoretical grounding
- Path to deeper learning

### 3. Designed for AI Invocation

Skills are structured so AI assistants can:
- Detect when a skill is relevant (trigger patterns)
- Suggest the appropriate skill
- Guide user through the workflow step-by-step
- Use tools (TodoWrite, AskUserQuestion) to facilitate process

**The vision:**
- User expresses frustration → AI suggests `creative:creative-block`
- User mentions conflict → AI suggests `communication:nvc-conversation`
- Friday afternoon → AI suggests `business:weekly-review`

AI becomes a skillful coach, not just an information provider.

### 4. Real Use Over Theory

Skills must be:
1. Used by creator in real situations
2. Proven to produce better outcomes
3. Refined based on actual experience
4. Removed if not actually used

**YAGNI for skills**: We don't need a skill for every possible situation. We need skills for situations that recur and where ad-hoc approaches fail.

**Test**: If you wouldn't follow this skill yourself, don't submit it.

## What This Is Not

### Not Self-Help Platitudes

**Platitude**: "Practice gratitude daily"
**Life Skill**: `inner:gratitude-practice` with specific 5-minute workflow

**Platitude**: "Set boundaries"
**Life Skill**: `communication:boundary-setting` with NVC-based conversation structure

### Not Rigid Rules

Skills are **frameworks for improvisation**, not scripts to follow blindly.

- Use the workflow as a guide
- Adapt to context
- Skip steps that don't apply
- But notice when you skip steps to avoid discomfort (that's the failure mode)

### Not Original Ideas

We **systematize existing wisdom**, not invent new theories.

If you find yourself inventing a new framework, stop. Find the established framework that covers this domain and systematize that instead.

## Design Decisions

### Workflow-Based vs. Principle-Based

**Decision**: Workflow-based (actionable steps)

**Rationale**: Principles are beautiful but vague. Workflows are actionable. When you're in the middle of a difficult conversation, you don't need to remember "communicate with empathy" - you need: "Step 1: Self-connection. What am I feeling and needing?"

### Unified Framework vs. Domain-Specific

**Decision**: Unified framework (consistent structure across domains)

**Rationale**: Easier to learn, easier to navigate, shows patterns across domains. The meta-structure is the same even though domain content differs.

### Context Suggestions vs. Manual Invocation

**Decision**: Hybrid (AI suggests, user confirms)

**Rationale**:
- Pure manual: Users forget skills exist
- Pure automatic: Feels intrusive, removes agency
- Hybrid: AI catches patterns, user maintains control

### Standalone vs. Integration-Only

**Decision**: Standalone + integration

**Rationale**:
- Useful without Claude Code (read markdown files directly)
- More powerful with Claude Code (AI-guided workflows)
- Broader adoption if not locked to one tool

## Constraints

### Compatible with Superpowers

Skills must coexist with superpowers without conflicts:
- Clear domain separation (code vs. life)
- Shared tools (TodoWrite, AskUserQuestion)
- Similar structure (familiar to superpowers users)

### Grounded in Established Frameworks

No invented frameworks. Every skill cites its source.

Exceptions:
- Meta-skills (using-life-skills, creating-life-skills)
- Integration/workflow skills that combine established frameworks

### Different from Code Skills

Non-code domains have different needs:
- More reflective/contemplative
- More use of AskUserQuestion for self-inquiry
- Less use of bash/file tools
- Qualitative outcomes vs. quantitative (tests pass/fail)

## Success Criteria

A skill is successful when:

1. **You actually use it** (not just theoretically nice)
2. **It produces better outcomes** than ad-hoc approach
3. **Others find it valuable** (community validation)
4. **It prevents known failure modes** (not just "nice to have")

A skill should be removed when:
- Not used in 6 months
- Better approach found
- Covered by another skill
- Theoretical rather than practical

**YAGNI applies to skills**: Don't keep skills "just in case". Keep only what's proven useful.

## Evolution

This framework will evolve through:

1. **Personal use**: Brian uses skills, refines based on experience
2. **Community contributions**: Others share what works for them
3. **Framework updates**: As GTD, NVC, etc. evolve, skills evolve
4. **Pruning**: Removing skills that don't get used

**Not through**:
- Inventing new theories
- Adding skills speculatively
- Keeping skills for completeness rather than usefulness

## Summary

**What**: Workflow-based practices preventing failure modes across life domains

**Why**: Systematic approaches work better than ad-hoc

**How**: Codify proven frameworks into AI-invocable workflows

**Measure**: Real use, improved outcomes, community adoption

**Philosophy**: Proven workflows > principles. Real use > theory. YAGNI always.
